# pytorch-tutorial

## Tutorial 1 - October 21, 2022
In this tutorial we will cover installation of PyTorch, Tensor basics and how to train your first neural network (MLP; multi-layer perceptron) in order to classify hand-written digits (aka MNIST dataset).
The aim is get our feet wet and hands dirty in the world of deep learning. Each tutorial will work to cover increasingly complex topics as well as best practices.
